This project is going to be a forum for a game server I am helping to run, I only have login and registration working at the moment, I plan to flesh out the forum soon and add steam login functionality.

It is a single page React/Redux application with responsive design utilising bootstrap and with an ASP.NET Core API using cookie authentication.
